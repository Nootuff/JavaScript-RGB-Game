# JavaScript RGB Guessing Game

Click on the square whose colour you think matches the RGB code!

An upgraded version of the colour guessing game featured on Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) course on Udemy, built using JavaScript. After following along with the instructions in building the base game, I decided to test my skills and make some modifications to the original design, adding a few new features and styles to make the finished project my own.

## New Features 

* Variable difficulty settings with a new gameplay mode limiting guesses for extra challenge. 
* Guess counter.
* Gameplay instructions tab. 
* Fully responsive layout.
